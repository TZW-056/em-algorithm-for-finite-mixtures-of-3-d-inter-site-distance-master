# EM algorithm for finite mixtures of 3D inter-site distance

#### Description
{**Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for resolving finite mixtures of 3D inter-site distance.**}

This code is written in Python. 
You need to install numpy, sklearn, scipy and matplotlib to use it.

It has been tested on simulated 3D inter-site distance data. (Simulation data is also provided here.)

If you feel that it is useful, please cite our work. Thank you.
